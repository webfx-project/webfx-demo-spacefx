# Live demo

The demo is published on [this page][demo-live-link].

This is a space game written in JavaFx.
To play it, you will need a computer with keyboard (instructions on start screen) , or a tablet with a bluetooth keyboard.
Since it loads quite a lot of resources (images & sounds), it may not start well with slow internet connections.

# Highlighted features

## Reusability

This demo demonstrates how you can port existing JavaFx applications.
This game was indeed already written [in JavaFx][hansolo-spacefx-link], and this demo is just a port of it in WebFx so the game could be transpiled into a Web Application.

## Canvas mapping

This demo also shows that you can write applications such as games using the JavaFx canvas API.
